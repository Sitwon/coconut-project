# Possibly useful flags:
# --line-numbers: add line number comments for ease of debugging
# --keep-lines: include source code in comments for ease of debugging
# --minify: compress compiled python
# --jobs <num>: number of additional processes to use (defaults to 0) (pass 'sys' to use machine default)
